Throughout Scotch’n’Soda’s early years, shows were performed, managed, and written entirely by students. 
Today, Workshopping embraces S’n’S’s origins by facilitating the creation of original student works. 
Workshopping hosts bimonthly lectures to build a ‘toolkit’ of skills for newbie writers, in addition 
to office hours to chat freely about projects and ideas. This sub-troupe also hosts staged readings 
of new plays and musicals, as well as oldies written by S’n’S alumni. We welcome writers of all 
experience levels! Find us on Facebook @snsworkshopping.
