NPP is Carnegie Mellon's most awesome (and only) improv theatre troupe! Whether you've had a lot of 
experience with improv or are just getting interested, NPP Workshops are a great way to 
improve your skills and have a lot of fun. In addition to workshops, our performance group, an audition 
based group within NPP, performs long form shows about twice a month in the blackbox theater on campus. 
You can drop into any of our workshops at any time, and you can even enroll in our StuCo, 
98-128 Fundamentals Of Improv Comedy and get 3 units of credit!
